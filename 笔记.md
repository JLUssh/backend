also installed on npm install on a directory that contains package.json, unless you pass the --production flag, or if the NODE_ENV=production environment variable is set

请求头和响应头
Now, to add a session to your login logic, follow these steps:

Create a secret key
Create a function to generate tokens at login
Add the generate-token function to the login logic

```
        let options = {
            maxAge: 20 * 60 * 1000, // would expire in 20minutes
            httpOnly: true, // The cookie is only accessible by the web server
            secure: true,
            sameSite: "None",
        };
        const token = user.generateAccessJWT(); // generate session token for user
        res.cookie("SessionID", token, options); // set the token to response header, so that the client sends it back on each subsequent request
        res.status(200).json({
            status: "success",
            message: "You have successfully logged in.",
        });
```

await next();
后续可能是异步操作

使用fetch需要手动的进行设置？

fetch
The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests and processing the responses.

Fetch is the modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest: unlike XMLHttpRequest, which uses callbacks, Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the modern web such as service workers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

With the Fetch API, you make a request by calling fetch(), which is available as a global function in both window and worker contexts. You pass it a Request object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request.

The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing the server's response. You can then check the request status and extract the body of the response in various formats, including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.

可能默认就是json格式的数据吧，应该是可以自己设置

The fetch() function will reject the promise on some errors, but not if the server responds with an error status like 404: so we also check the response status and throw if it is not OK.

服务器内部执行过程中的错误，而不是资源请求不到等错误
请注意，与 fetch() 本身一样，json() 是异步的，访问响应主体内容的所有其他方法也是如此
a definition of the resource to fetch. This can be any one of:

a string containing the URL

an object, such an instance of URL, which has a stringifier that produces a string containing the URL

a Request instance

The request body is the payload of the request: it's the thing the client is sending to the server. You cannot include a body with GET requests, but it's useful for requests that send content to the server, such as POST or PUT requests.

GET requests don't have a body, but you can still send data to the server by appending it to the URL as a query string.
. This is a common way to send form data to the server. You can do this by using URLSearchParams to encode the data, and then appending it to the URL

```
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.append("username", "example");

// GET request sent to https://example.org/login?username=example
const response = await fetch(`https://example.org/login?${params}`);

```

Making cross-origin requests

Including credentials in cross-origin requests can make a site vulnerable to CSRF attacks, so even if credentials is set to include, the server must also agree to their inclusion by including the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in its response. Additionally, in this situation the server must explicitly specify the client's origin in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header (that is, \* is not allowed).

HTTP request methods

but some characteristics are shared across multiple methods, specifically request methods can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should not contain a request content.

POST
The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request content.

三个指标 safe cacheable idempotent
get head 可以缓存

使用 options 作为预检请求

Including credentials in cross-origin requests can make a site vulnerable to CSRF attacks, so even if credentials is set to include, the server must also agree to their inclusion by including the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in its response. Additionally, in this situation the server must explicitly specify the client's origin in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header (that is, \* is not allowed).

If the request is a simple request, then the request will be sent with credentials, but the server must set the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials and Access-Control-Allow-Origin response headers, or the browser will return a network error to the caller. If the server does set the correct headers, then the response, including credentials, will be delivered to the caller.

To make a request cancelable, create an AbortController, and assign its AbortSignal to the request's signal property.

To cancel the request, call the controller's abort() method. The fetch() call will reject the promise with an AbortError exception.

abortcontroller
When the abort method on the controller is called, the fetch operation and every subsequent, then methods are discarded, and the catch method is executed.

中断请求后，需要进行错误的捕捉

if there’s no catch the error is passed to the caller. In create-react-app development mode, the error will overlay your page.

Cancelling any Promise

The Response.status property tells us the numerical status code, and the Response.ok property returns true if the status is in the 200 range.

response 响应对象

request 请求对象

返回的数据可能有不同的格式，最通用的是json
对应于 application/json
The Response interface provides a number of methods to retrieve the entire body contents in a variety of different formats:

Response.arrayBuffer()
Response.blob()
Response.formData()
Response.json()
Response.text()

```
const image = document.querySelector("img");

const url = "flowers.jpg";

async function setImage() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const blob = await response.blob();
    const objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    image.src = objectURL;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
}
```

获取数据是异步的

The main difference between both of them is that sessions are saved on the server-side, whereas cookies are saved on the user’s browser or client-side.

```
const randomId = (signal = null, delay = 3000) =>
  new Promise((accept, cancel) => {
    const id = Date.now().toString(36) + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2);

    const timeout = setTimeout(accept, delay, id);

    //// 对一个相应的事件进行监听即可
    if (signal instanceof AbortSignal) {
      signal.addEventListener(
        "abort",
        () => {
          clearTimeout(timeout);
          cancel("Cancelled");
        },
        {
          once: true
        }
      );
    }
  });
```

This randomId function can now take an optional signal. If the signal is an instance of AbortSignal then we attach an event listener to it, which will clear the ongoing timeout, when an abort event happens.

This event listener shall be ran only once.

logout 有两种方法
第二种不被推荐
One is to blacklist the request cookie on logout
the other is to invalidate the cookie by sending an invalid cookie to the client.
The latter is not advisable because if the previous cookie was kept somewhere before logout, it can still be used to log in.
